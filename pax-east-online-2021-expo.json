Collect natural resources, build production and living facilities, and produce essential supplies to bring peace and prosperity to your people.\r\n\r\nResidents and Life\r\nThe residents have their own preferences and emotions. They are happy when they have nice houses to live in, and will become distressed if they don't have any entertainment. Try to observe them and build housing, arrange jobs, and provide education and necessary leisure and entertainment. Make their wishes come true to earn their worship and trust.\r\n\r\nGods and Magic\r\nAs a local land god, you have access to some basic magic like changing the location of things in town. If you want to use stronger magic, you'll have to use the offerings of your people to meet other gods that can lend you their power and help develop your town. For example, the Moon Elder can greatly increase your people's willingness to get married and have kids, while the Weather Master can help you control the weather...\r\nBuildings and Decoration\r\n\r\nMonsters and Puppets\r\nThe town isn't always a peaceful place. Prosperous towns attract monsters that will come to destroy your buildings and take away your resources. You can build city walls and towers to delay monster attacks, and can also use spells as you lead your residents in battle to repel the monsters with the help of battle puppets.\r\n","price":null,"link":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1426730\/The_Immortal_Mayor\/","image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/32\/17\/52\/18cc673e-5dab-454a-8a60-0df705c3447f.jpg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/32\/17\/52\/18cc673e-5dab-454a-8a60-0df705c3447f.jpg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/32\/17\/52\/18cc673e-5dab-454a-8a60-0df705c3447f.jpg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/32\/17\/52\/18cc673e-5dab-454a-8a60-0df705c3447f.jpg"}},{"id":"33311","title":"Reshaping Mars","description":"Reshaping Mars is a mars-themed construction & strategy simulation game developed by one person.

From beginner-friendly options to driving modes that\u2019ll challenge the most expert drivers.

Dune took his initial inspiration from many hours spent playing the original Colin Mcrae rally games on PC in the early 2000's, as well as his time driving WRC cars from the 1990s in New Zealand. During the development process Dune attended DirtFish rally school in an effort to gain a better understanding of how rally cars work. Much of the development was done in a camper van that he lives in while doing road trips around Canada, America and Mexico.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.\r\n\r\nBuy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of the broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy those that can\u2019t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.\r\n\r\nThe more you widen your gas station\u2019s appeal, the more customer demands will vary. The truckers want a healthy meal and a shower while the Tesla driver wants a Latte while he waits for his car to charge up. Expand the range of services you offer by adding stations, buildings and appropriate equipment. Why not expand and build a shop area, build a car wash station or even a small motel? How about some slot machines to ramp up the profits?\r\n\r\nRestoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built, ranging from your own color schemes, the name of your gas station to decorations inside and outside.\r\nDon\u2019t forget to advertise! Letting people know about your existence and services you expand will drive even more customers to you. It might not come cheap, but pays for itself in the long run.\r\n\r\nServing your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up and their food served right away. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper time management and closing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy.\r\n\r\nYou can try, but the more you expand the less likely that you will be able to manage it all on your own. Hire the right people to help you run your business, but keep a close eye on them. Some employees might just not do their job right, slack, lack the right attitude to serve customers or even steal.\r\n\r\nYou can\u2019t sell what you don\u2019t have.

You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, the wildlife and find your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you haven\u2019t suffered any injuries during the fall, you lost your backpack and hence most of your gear and supplies. You will need to find shelter, find some food and rest. Then it\u2019s about making your way to an old ranger station to call for rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSounds easy enough, doesn\u2019t it? It is, except for the supplies you are going to need for the trip, the weather, the freezing cold, not to mention the wildlife. The goal of the game is to survive. To prepare enough to make the trip to the ranger station and to deal with all the surprises along the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunt or be hunted. You have no rifle and there is no combat. If you encounter wolfs or even a bear, stay away and run. You won\u2019t be able to kill a bear with a knife, it\u2019s not the movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you can do is be clever about the wildlife and set traps. You might even be able to find some traps hunters left behind and use them to maintain a safe perimeter or to hunt smaller animals for food. Tracking, establishing the best spot and being patient is what the hunt will be about.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold, thirst, hunger and exhaustion are the four major factors you have to worry about. It doesn\u2019t however end there. Injuries are another one and there is the weather. Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isn\u2019t any better either. Don\u2019t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable. You have to be prepared at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are not the first one person in this area. There have been many before you. More than a century ago some even lived here. If you explore your surroundings there is a good chance they may have left something behind that will still be useful to you. And while building a shelter on your own is certainly an option, it is a lot better and safer to adapt something that already exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could find an old hunter lodge and fix it up to offer decent shelter and a base of operations for you to prepare, gather supplies and food and even hunt. You are going to have a long trip ahead of you. The better you prepare, the less risky it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rescue isn\u2019t going to be instant. Despite modern equipment and well trained mountain rescue personnel, you are far away and their helicopter can\u2019t take off in any weather. Between you calling for help and help actually arriving might take even a couple of days. Additional time you have to survive in the bitter cold at Mount Washington.\r\n","price":"0.00","link":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1394960\/Winter_Survival_Simulator\/?curator_clanid=35934053","image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/44\/89\/8\/f327cde0-1b1d-46a9-b094-73825fea44d2.jpg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/44\/89\/8\/f327cde0-1b1d-46a9-b094-73825fea44d2.jpg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/44\/89\/8\/f327cde0-1b1d-46a9-b094-73825fea44d2.jpg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/44\/89\/8\/f327cde0-1b1d-46a9-b094-73825fea44d2.jpg"}},{"id":"36322","title":"Food Truck Simulator","description":"While sitting at the office during yet another boring meeting, you come across an ad for an old food truck for sale.

- Integrating Geek Culture Into Therapeutic Practice: The Clinician's Guide To Geek Therapy","description":"Have you ever had a client who talks about Video Games, Dungeons and Dragons, Anime, or Comic Books? Likely they identify as a Geek. \r\n\r\nBeing a geek can be seen as difficult for many; the social awkwardness, ineptitude, and judgment from others leads individuals to feel isolated in a world of their own. Geeks, by traditional definition, are passionate about anthologies and characters from a variety of fictional, fantasy, and virtual formats that are sometimes niche or unpopular, creating feelings of relatedness towards avatar experiences in an often otherwise lonely life.\r\n\r\nIntegrating Geek Culture into Therapeutic Practice: The Clinician's Guide to Geek Therapy is a comprehensive compendium of how Geek Therapy clinicians and scholars currently use a variety of games, media artifacts, and other geek culture items in therapeutic context and intervention. Even more important, the authors within this book are currently at the forefront of their research fields and are accordingly considered experts within the growing field of Geek Therapy clinical practice. Throughout the book, leading researchers within the field of Psychology, Communication Studies, and more have been able to provide clinical examples, research-based approaches, and specifics about how to utilize these items therapeutically - further enhancing the material and providing solid supportive guidance for clinicians. Clinicians reading this can develop further competence and understanding of the concepts found within their practices which will be helpful for their personal success and cultural competence to best serve their clientele.\r\n\r\nThese modalities have resulted in clients experiencing:\r\n\r\nReduced anxiety and depressive symptoms\r\nImproved self-esteem\r\nRicher interpersonal interactions\r\nGreater social and school engagement and\r\nSuperior development of social skills and problem solving\r\nThese techniques are being used to improve overall psychological well-being across all ages, as well as focusing on the specific needs of targeted populations, such as those with ADHD, ASD, PTSD, and mood and anxiety disorders.

With narratives revolving around grandiose stories of good versus evil, Final Fantasy has allowed us, as players, to witness heroic battles, experience hard-won victories, and create treasured friendships for almost 40 years.\r\n\r\nThe Psychology of Final Fantasy guides gamers on a real-world quest of self-discovery so that they can surpass their own limit break. And, as part of this examination, psychologists, clinicians, video game researchers, professors, and enthusiasts who love this franchise ask:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does the storyline in Final Fantasy grab and keep our attention for so many hours of gameplay?\r\nWhy do the symbols in the game, such as crystals, magic, and weapons, hold meaning about our own psychological inner workings?\r\nWhat are the feminine warrior and archetypes found in the game and how are they living in all of our everyday lives?\r\nHow does playing Final Fantasy connect us with a larger sense of spiritual guidance as to who we are?\r\nWhy is it that, by creating a group, we become whole more than we do when playing as individuals?\r\nHow do the musical interludes affect our psyche and push us to become better versions of ourselves?\r\n \r\n\r\nThink you know Final Fantasy? The Psychology of Final Fantasy explores how the game resonates with a player's psychological drive toward an emotional sense of wholeness, bonding, and completion as they take part in this epic quest.","price":"15.99","link":"https:\/\/shop.geektherapeutics.com\/products\/the-psychology-of-final-fantasy-surpassing-the-limit-break-signed-copy","image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/62\/58\/37\/21552b8d-1146-4863-ae59-29234411e32a.jpg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/62\/58\/37\/21552b8d-1146-4863-ae59-29234411e32a.jpg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/62\/58\/37\/21552b8d-1146-4863-ae59-29234411e32a.jpg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/62\/58\/37\/21552b8d-1146-4863-ae59-29234411e32a.jpg"}},{"id":"28556","title":"SIGNED - The Psychology of Zelda: Linking Our World to the Legend of Zelda Series","description":"For more than 30 years, The Legend of Zelda\u2014which immerses players in a courageous struggle against the shadowy forces of evil in a world of high fantasy\u2014has spanned more than 30 different installments, selling over 75 million copies. Today, it is one of the most beloved video game franchises around the globe. \r\n\r\nVideo game sales as a whole have continued to grow, now raking in twice as much money per year as the entire film industry, and countless psychologists have turned their attention to the effects gaming has on us: our confidence, our identity, and our personal growth. The Psychology of Zelda applies the latest psychological findings, plus insights from classic psychology theory, to Link, Zelda, Hyrule, and the players who choose to wield the Master Sword. \r\n\r\nIn The Psychology of Zelda, psychologists who love the games ask: \r\n\r\nHow do Link\u2019s battles in Ocarina of Time against Dark Link, his monstrous doppelganger, mirror the difficulty of confronting our personal demons and the tendency to be our own worst enemies?\r\nWhat lessons about pursuing life\u2019s greater meaning can we take away from Link\u2019s quests through Hyrule and beyond the stereotypical video game scenario of rescuing a Princess (Zelda)?\r\nWhat do we experience as players when we hear that familiar royal lullaby on the ocarina, Saria\u2019s spirited melody in the Lost Woods, or the iconic main theme on the title screen?\r\nHow do the obstacles throughout Majora\u2019s Mask represent the Five Stages of Grief?\r\nWhat can Link\u2019s journey to overcome the loss of the fairy Navi teach us about understanding our own grief and depression?\r\nWhy are we psychologically drawn to the game each and every time a new version becomes available even when they all have a similar storyline? \r\nThink you\u2019ve completed the quest?

I have been meticulously trained on the best interactive entertainment available today and my data indicates you will be completely satisfied with the result. However, your valuable human feedback is required to help me further adjust and develop this experience.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- Maneuver objects, divert lasers, and manipulate electricity to overcome 130+ surprising genre-bending puzzles.\r\n- Outwit a metrics-obsessed machine intent on heckling you for your humanity.\r\n- View and contribute to in-game analytics that are updated in real time with real player data.\r\n\r\nThe Game:\r\nLab Rat is a hand-crafted narrative puzzler masquerading as a machine-generated video game. This satirical adventure stars a metrics-obsessed AI who will monitor, profile, and guide you as you solve over a hundred unique spatial problems. Over time this AI will develop a hilariously-misguided understanding of humanity based on your performance and survey response data.\r\n\r\nThe Team:\r\nWhile Lab Rat pokes fun at the absurdity of algorithmically-generated interactions, this game is lovingly hand-crafted by a team of expert human developers. Lab Rat is directed by Gwen Frey (creator of Kine & co-creator of The Flame in the Flood). It features environment art by Mike Snight (Lead World Builder, Bioshock Infinite), writing by Matthew Burns (creator of Eliza), and puzzles by Lucas Le Slo (beloved experimental puzzle designer).","website":"chumpsquad.com","store_url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1304610\/Lab_Rat\/","featured":false,"booth":"","category":"Exhibitors","category_id":"4689","tags":[{"id":"2375","tag":"PC"},{"id":"2401","tag":"Indie"},{"id":"2458","tag":"Strategy"},{"id":"2476","tag":"Third Person"}],"image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/68\/7\/9\/fa022d3e-c36d-4931-a478-3e74be23387b.jpg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/68\/7\/9\/fa022d3e-c36d-4931-a478-3e74be23387b.jpg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/68\/7\/9\/fa022d3e-c36d-4931-a478-3e74be23387b.jpg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/68\/7\/9\/fa022d3e-c36d-4931-a478-3e74be23387b.jpg"},"specials":[{"id":"33166","title":"Wishlist Lab Rat","description":"Wishlist on Steam today!","price":"0.00","link":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1304610\/Lab_Rat\/","image":[]},{"id":"33169","title":"FREE closed Beta!","description":"We add new beta testers every month.

No one knew where and when the first contact was made, but the fated meeting between the two species was a fact.\r\n\r\nThe players in Moo Lander have three different types of abilities to choose from when progressing the game. These are the Lethal Attacks, the Non-Lethal Attacks and the Defensive Abilities. The first two are, as implied, attacks to fight enemies with. The third type is purely defensive \u2013 think of them as the main means to your survival during the harsh adventures in Moo Lander.\r\n\r\n\r\nLethal attacks\r\nThe lethal attacks are used against the many intelligent enemies.\r\n\r\n - Milk Bullet - a simple milk bullet, fired automatically through a common barrel inside the ship - fast and effective.\r\n - Machinegun - It heats milk to high temperatures, then fires small projectiles at amazing speed.\r\n - Sparks - Milk projectiles that shoot in a wide range around the ship hitting all living organisms, no matter what\r\n - M Laser - The \"M\" stands for the mayhem class level of the weapon. The laser will fry everything in it's way.\r\n - Milk Saber - the milksmiths used their minds to carve out a blade of pure milk - indestructible matter which can slice through anything.\r\n - Milk Grenade - This weapon doesn\u2019t look like a grenade itself, but rather a compressed super-dense mass of milk being hurled at any direction that deals area damage on impact.\r\n - Milk Arrows - Small arrows, or rather \u2013 bolts, with a specific trajectory in the form of an arc. When these milky stingers hit a target or a terrain, they explode in small radius after a delay.\r\n - Milk Seeking Missile - This missile does not seek milk in enemies per se, but rather the large mass of milk is naturally drawn to hostile creatures that are a threat to the Lander.\r\n - Mooriken - Concentrated milk particles into high density single points in space, then released with maximum velocity - this attack will penetrate through the toughest enemies\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Lethal attacks\r\nThe non-lethal attacks are made specially for taming the Ancient Mighty Cows, as they must not be harmed in order to be beamed back to your home planet. These attacks are three in number and if used against common enemies, they only stun a target.\r\n\r\n - Charge - It is not milk-based, as everything milky will not harm the cows. If these charges hit a non-bovine lifeform, they electrify the nervous system, stunning the target. \r\n - Zap - A straight line of electric current is the name of the game when it comes to The Zap. This weapon shoots down a wide beam of electricity, stunning all other lifeforms besides the cows themselves\r\n - Shock Bomb - It is slow, only dropping linearly downwards, with minimal control over the projectile, the bombs greatly weaken every type of bovine lifeform.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefensive abilities\r\nThe defensive abilities are also three and are used only for defense as well as mitigating attacks or deflecting projectiles.\r\n\r\n - Defender Drones - These little mechanical critters hover around the Lander\u2019s ship and activate at the slightest trace of danger.\r\n - Push Wave - By creating a massive sound barrier and pushing it forward, they shield themselves from incoming projectiles, lifeforms or natural disasters of all kinds. \r\n - Milk Shield - This shield is almost indestructible and projectiles can even bounce back off the shield instead of being absorbed by it\r\n\r\n\r\nAt any given time, the player may equip one defensive ability of a kind, one lethal attack and one non-lethal attack. Each of these is unlocked through leveling up and buying the chosen ability with the milk resource. In addition, every ability (defensive or offensive) can be upgraded once for maximum efficiency. The upgrades are also unlocked through leveling up and purchasable with milk.","price":"0.00","link":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1080040\/Moo_Lander\/","image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/30\/1\/30\/33743bda-cb72-4186-87cb-bbee3c5027ae.jpg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/30\/1\/30\/33743bda-cb72-4186-87cb-bbee3c5027ae.jpg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/30\/1\/30\/33743bda-cb72-4186-87cb-bbee3c5027ae.jpg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/30\/1\/30\/33743bda-cb72-4186-87cb-bbee3c5027ae.jpg"}},{"id":"36330","title":"DEMO OUT NOW - Moo Lander","description":"Moo Lander has it all \u2013 unlockable battle abilities, worthy enemy AI, Cow boss battles, beautiful art style, self-recorded orchestral music, RPG elements, multiplayer and lots and lots of milk!
